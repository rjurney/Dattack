SUMMARY

	This application reads your entire inbox via data/process_imap, and monitors your realtime inbox stream via data/process_emails.rb

SETUP
	Note: JRuby is available at http://jruby.org.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/1.6.2/jruby-bin-1.6.2.tar.gz if you do not already have it installed.  The jgem command should be available once you add JRuby's bin directory to your path.

	STEP 1) Run install.sh to download/clone, build and install dependencies.  Depending on your JRuby setup, you may need to sudo the gem installs.
	STEP 2) Run stage_app.sh to initialize dependent services (voldemort)

SCRAPING YOUR INBOX
	At the moment, the only supported email provider is Gmail.  To scrape your Gmail account, run:
	
	jruby data/process_imap.sh <username@gmail.com> <password>
	
VISUALIZATION
	Download Gephi from http://gephi.org/users/download/ and load the graphml file that data/process_imap.rb created in /tmp
